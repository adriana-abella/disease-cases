The following web site provides the updated numbers for coronavirus: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ . Please plot the number of new cases for each country on a world map. The numbers are updated every day. The code ignores the locations that do not relate to a country (e.g. "Diamond Princess") as it collects data regarding new found cases worldwide and plots them in a world map.
